# Safe spaces needed for drug-addicted children, say grieving mums

In January 2025 we [investigated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyxle17jl8o) the failings of drug treatment for young people. 

Analysis showed more than half of the 16,000 children in drug and alcohol treatment in the past year were 15 or younger.

The [National Drug Treatment Monitoring System](https://www.ndtms.net/) data showed a 13% rise in under-18s seeking support in 2024-25, yet experts and families say many are not receiving the help needed.

The BBC found disparities in community care, gaps in strategy and a shortage of beds for those in crisis.
